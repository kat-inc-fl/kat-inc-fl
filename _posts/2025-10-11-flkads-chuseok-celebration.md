Come on down and connect with a couple dozen (and counting!) Korean adoptees and their families for an evening full of fun:

- 🥟 Traditional Korean food  
- 🎶 Traditional Korean music performance  
- 🥋 Taekwondo demonstration  
- 🎨 Crafts & games for all ages  
- 🤝 Plenty of time to mingle and share stories  

📍 The event will be held at a community center space generously provided by a local church in Winter Garden, FL. There’s no religious affiliation with this gathering — the church is simply opening their doors, providing catering, and lending volunteers to help us host (and keep the kiddos busy with the games/crafts).  

To show our appreciation, we’re suggesting a *voluntary* $10 donation per adult that will go directly to the church (payable in cash at the door).  

There will be a second get-together the following morning: an **adult-KAD-only brunch** on Sunday at 11am. This gathering will be free and hosted by a local KAD.  

This weekend is made possible thanks to many generous volunteers, so come ready to relax, connect, and enjoy a nice time together!  

Please RSVP no later than **9/27** to help with an accurate head count for food and seating: [http://bit.ly/466g6jX](http://bit.ly/466g6jX)
