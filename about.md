## About Korean Adoptees Together

**Korean Adoptees Together, Inc.** is a 501(c)(3) organization founded in Jacksonville, Florida. We hope to inspire and support Korean adoptees through meet-ups and events throughout the year.  

Our mission is to foster communication and support among Korean adoptees, provide a safe haven for facilitating connections, embrace the diversity of experiences and perspectives, and celebrate a strong sense of identity as individuals and as a community.  

Our vision is to provide more opportunities and access for Korean adoptees to build relationships and participate in meaningful experiences throughout the Southeastern U.S.  

Social media has brought many of us together virtually, and we hope to strengthen those bonds through more face-to-face gatherings.  

We look forward to collaborating with other organizations that support adoptees and the broader Korean American community. Join us as we come together to celebrate and connect with our fellow Korean adoptees.
