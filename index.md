## Welcome to Korean Adoptees Together

We are a nonprofit organization supporting Korean adoptees and their families. Our goal is to foster connection, share experiences, and celebrate identity.  

We’re currently focusing on **small, local meetups in the Northeast Florida region**, with the hope of hosting larger events that bring more adoptees together.
